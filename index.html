      <p>My projects created at Epicodus as of August 3rd 2017. <em>Please note that all of the following projects were paired projects and used languages html and css.</em></p>
      <p>
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/LaineyRokk/hello-world">hello-world</a>
          This was my first paired project at epicodus and was a simple page saying "hello world" in 5 langaugesz.</li>
          <li><a href+"https://github.com/LaineyRokk/goodbye">goodbye</a>
          The goodbye project was a simple follow up to the hello world project reflectively displaying the word "goodbye" in several langauges.</li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/LaineyRokk/cookie-recipe">cookie-recipe</a>
          A project created to display a page containing the "best cookie recipe."</li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/LaineyRokk/first-webpage">first-webpage</a>
          This project was our first attempt at creating a real webpage. It contained two pages; one titled "my first webpage" and the second, "my favorite things." This was also the first time adding a README.md. on to a github repository.</li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/LaineyRokk/resort_website">resort_website</a>
          This assignment was meant to be a webpage for a vacation resort.</li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/LaineyRokk/cupcake_shop">cupcake_shop</a>
          The cupcake shop project was a bit more challenging as we had to have mutltiple linked pages along with adding several images</li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/LaineyRokk/boring_leecture">boring_leecture</a>
          This "boring lecture" assignment was a bit of fun as we were aloud to choose our own topic and put a little personal style into the simple page allowing us to get more practice with our html tags</li>
          <li><a href="https://github.com/LaineyRokk/blog_site">blog_site</a>This was a very interesting project,creating a fake blog site, as we were first introduced to the uses of lorem ipsum.</li>
        </ul>

      <p> Why I am here at Epicodus? This is a very difficult and very involved question as it seems large portions of my life have had to change in order to have arrived here, working hard at this school, struggling but tetermined to succeed at something that does not come naturally to me. I suppose the long and short of it is, despite my wide range of post-high school education, this past year I found myself at a cross roads; either continue on in my study (<em>and love</em>) of psychology, knowing full well I would be spending anywhere from one and a half to upwards of five or more years in school to achieve the level of certification I would need to actually be employable in my field, <strong>OR</strong> find a quicker means of education and certification so I could find a vocation I could enjoy and become highly employable with and then consider my return to higher education later in life when I have the financial means and a stable alternate-carrier path. At this point in time I had a fair stroke of luck as I had recently heard of my fiance's cousin, who upon acquiring her bachelor's degree had realized it was close to useless in terms of employment and had discovered a wonderful new type of school; a programming bootcamp-style school. She said it was very challenging, making her feel both smarter than ever and dumb as a stump at the same time. However she perceivered and only a little over a year after graduating this bootcamp school she had been employed at two exptremely prestigious companies and was constantly getting offeres from others allowing her to live a very comfortable life in downtown Seattle. Seeing as how I and my fiance' both had a strong desire to move back to the Portland/Vancouver area I started researching programming bootcamps in the area. Low and behold here I am less than a year later, freshly moved into a new apartment and working as hard as I can less than a week after moving to succeed in this very challenign but interesting field at what seems to very much be the best programming school in the area.
